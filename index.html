        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>From burritos to quesadillas, you really can’t go wrong with chicken wrapped in a tortilla! Flautas are our new favorite obsession. 
        Made with shredded chicken wrapped in flour tortillas and then pan-fried, they’re somewhere between taquitos and chimichangas. 
        They come together quickly, making them perfect party appetizers or a great weeknight meal served with Mexican rice and beans. 

        The really great thing about these is how versatile they are. 
        You can use rotisserie chicken, cheddar, and queso blanco like we have here, or change it up with what you prefer or have at home. 
        We’ve added flavor and spice with the addition of canned green chiles, but you can use salsa or pickled jalapenos instead. 
        You could also use a different combination of cheeses such as Monterey jack, pepper jack, Oaxaca, or feta. 
        For a variation, try shredded pork instead of chicken. </p>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 c. shredded, cooked chicken</li>
            <li>1/4 c. canned, chopped green chiles </li>
            <li>1 c. shredded cheddar </li>
            <li>1 c. queso blanco (or crumbled feta)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt (omit if chicken is already seasoned)</li>
            <li>2 tsp. hot sauce, optional</li>
            <li>10 7" flour tortillas</li>
            <li>1/2 c. vegetable, canola, or other neutral oil</li>
            <li>For serving: pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Steps</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine chicken, chiles, cheeses, salt, and hot sauce (if using).</li>
            <li>Lay 1 tortilla down on a work surface. Spread a heaping 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla. Roll up tightly and place seam side down on a plate. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.</li>
            <li>In a 10” skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches between 350-375 degrees F. (You want to hear a sizzle as soon as the food hits the oil.)</li>
            <li>Add 3 of the flautas to the oil, seam side down. Cook, turning every 30 to 60 seconds, until golden all over, about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer flautas to a large paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet. Repeat with remaining flautas. Serve immediately with pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole.</li>
        </ol>
