    <h1>Chicken Parmesan Pasta</h1>

    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>When it comes to cooking, we love a one-pot deal: fewer dishes and more flavor. When you keep using the same pan to cook different components of a dish, all the fond that collects on the bottom of your pan gets rolled over into the next stage. 

        This is why we cook bacon first, then sear our chicken breasts in that same pan: The salty goodness of crisped pork belly transfers over to the leaner white meat. Toasting our panko in that same pan leads to an even more flavorful bread-crumb topping, complete with a slightly spicy, Italian-seasoned everything bagel spice addition.
        
        If you bought chicken breasts instead of cutlets, you can just trim them down to size, cut about Â½" thick. You can use store-bought or homemade marinara. With a recipe this flexible, any sauce you like will do just fine, as long as you jazz it up with all those garlic cloves, a touch of sugar and spice, and a generous helping of cheese!</p>

        <h3><strong>For The Tomato sauce</strong></h3>

        <li>1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>

        <li>1 (32-oz.) jar marinara</li>
        <li>2 tsp. granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 c. water</li>
        <h3><strong>For The Pasta</strong></h3>
        <li>1 lb. short pasta, such as campanelle or penne</li>
        <li>8 oz. shredded mozzarella, divided</li>
        <li>3/4 c. freshly grated Parmesan or Pecorino, divided</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs, such as basil and parsley, for garnish</li>

    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make chicken: In a large, deep-sided skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crispy and fat is rendered, 4 to 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a plate; keep bacon fat in skillet.
            In a shallow dish, whisk together flour, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, onion powder, and garlic powder. Return skillet to medium-high heat. Lightly coat chicken cutlets in flour mixture and add to skillet. Cook, flipping halfway, until both sides are deeply golden, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate.</li>
        <li>Make panko topping: Return skillet to medium-low heat. Add oil, panko bread crumbs, Italian seasoning, everything bagel seasoning, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring frequently, until panko mixture is golden, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Make sauce: Return skillet to medium heat and add oil, garlic, pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Cook, stirring, until garlic is golden. Add marinara, sugar, and water and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until noodles are al dente and sauce is creamy, about 12 minutes. </li>
        <li>Fold in half the mozzarella and Parmesan until melty. Slice cooked chicken on the bias into strips and place on top of pasta. Remove skillet from heat, sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan, and cover with lid to melt cheese, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with panko topping, cooked bacon, and fresh herbs. </li>
    </ol>
